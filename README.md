Description:

Core is a open source plugin providing a good foundation for any server using Sponge (https://www.spongepowered.org/)
It's commands are very extended so you are able to rollback your banlist, create private warps and invite players,
add limitations for anything (ex: tempbanning).. and a lot more! Feedback is always appreciated and can be written
down at Core's [official thread](https://forums.spongepowered.org/t/core-v1-8-2b-kick-ban-mute-teleport-homes-warps-spawns-time-weather-and-much-more/9152) at the sponge forums.
